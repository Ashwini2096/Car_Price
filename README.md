Car Price Prediction 
Objective:
The main objective of the Car Price Prediction project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of a used car based on input features such as brand, model, year, mileage, and market trends.

Features:
Data preprocessing: The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (car price).
Model Development: Building machine learning models to predict car prices based on the input features. Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression .
